## Project Requirements

### Content

My profile picture was chosen, because it's professional, yet still shows my personality, and I believe that should shine through with any porfolio to reveal more character. Keeping this in mind, my biography was also written in a context the outlines my profressional and tertiary experience, yet also adds some sparkle at the end, with a few insights into what my life is like when I'm away from my laptop.
